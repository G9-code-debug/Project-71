            <label>Dear Friends,
              For us at St. Joseph High School, Dabwali, it is a constant endeavour to provide the best quality educationYou can teach student a lesson for a day, if you can teach him to learn by creating curiosity, he/she will continue the learning process as long as he/she lives.Down the ages our concept of education has undergone a gradual metamorphosis. Yet the intrinsic values and principles have generally remained unchanged. Education is not how much you know. Its the empowerment that differentiates between what you know and what you dont.It is with this vision that St. Joseph School, Dabwali has forged ahead with a mission to hone and integrate the personality of all students under its fold. The curriculum is the focus of our attention, and we work hard to ensure that is age appropriate (not only in content but also in its sequence), that it is a student sensitive and it is meaningful (an approach that is multi disciplinary and hands on).	
              
              
              Our supportive and nourishing environment values each student as an individual. We enable our students to devolve all attribute and skills for lifelong learning, initiative and excellence, confidence and self esteem, discipline and dedication, integrity and honesty and creativity with imagination. To support our efforts, parents can play a very important role. The schools goals are aligned with that of parents best interest of the child. For this it is useful that parents lend their cooperation and understanding to the school. The child education is the investment for his/her future. The more positive the school - parent relationship, the more secure a child will feel.There are number of opportunities for interaction. Please participate in the school access days and PTSM. Encourage your child to participate in all school activities and complete home assignments sincerely. Communicate with the teacher for any concern you have regarding progress. Read the school diary carefully, it will help you to understand the policies and procedures of the school. Fill out the information accurately for it will help us to help your child. It will always be my priority that the quality of education maintains the highest standards in our school, and am sure I can count on your support at all times.<br>(Fr. Ivo R. Dias) Principal

              Be the change you would like to see are the famous words of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation that reverberates down the ages with their timeless appeal. Never in the history of our nation did these words hold deeper meaning and relevance than today. We stand on the threshold of a great nation being ripped apart by sectarian values, religious bigotry and growing intolerance. The country that once celebrated it`s rich diversity and prided itself on its variegated cultures that painted a rich tapestry of vibrant hues of multi-ethnic, multi-linguistic and multi-religious diversity, stands in grave danger of menacing mind–sets that threaten to undermine and probably destroy this rich legacy, this treasured heritage. Now more than ever, let us through the agency of our institutions be harbingers of peace, unity and tolerance….. and where better could we start, if not through our schools that offers us the pooled power of young minds? Let us then arise to this challenge to bring in a new India where every Indian can hold his/her head high as citizens of a proud nation that can steer the course of its own destiny.<br>( Fr. Dominick M. Falcao sfx )

            The Society of the Missionaries of St. Francis Xavier, Pilar commonly known as the Society of Pilar, was founded on 26th September, 1887 by Fr. Bento Martins who was an ordinary priest with extraordinary vision. Inspired by the zeal to make Jesus Christ known to the places brought under the erstwhile Portuguese Rule, he formed a group of like minded priests and named the Society after the great Missionary, Francis Xavier.In 1891, they transferred their headquarters to the Monastry of Our Lady of Pilar. It is a beautiful hillock situated 12 kms. South East of Panjim, the capital of Goa. Thus the group came to be known as the Pilar Fathers. On 2nd July, 1939, Fr. Remedios Gomes along with Five other priests and two laymen, gave the Society the much needed vitality and stability by revamping the Constitution. They would now commit their efforts mainly to share the Gospel of Jesus to those who did not know him.The Pilat Society is an indigenous Society founded with the aim of sharing the Gospel of Justice, freedom and love with our countrymen.
